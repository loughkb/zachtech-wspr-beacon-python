# zachtech-wspr-beacon-python
python script to configure basic settings in the wspr beacon using linux

This is my first python program, so be gentle.  I know it's probably nasty and ugly, but it is functional.
I am not affiliated with zachtek, I just own the wspr beacon and use it.
I can be emailed at loughkb@yahoo.com with questions.
